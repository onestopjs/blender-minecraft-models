# Blender Minecraft Models

## Purpose
This repository aims to collect all Minecraft models made in Blender.

I couldn't really find Minecraft blocks made in Blender so I decided to start this repository to collect all the blocks I make and publish them for anyone else who needs them.

## Contents
So far, the blocks have just the block model, the texture, and a normal map applied. If someone with more knowledge knows how to make them better, suggestions (or directly pull requests) are welcome!

## Contributions
Contributions are more than welcome. So far, it's just me who is working on it, so if a block doesn't exist, you can probably go ahead and create it, then make a pull request.

If more people start contributing, I will think about creating an issue tracking all the blocks in progress.

If you create something, you may want to check the resourcepack (in the credits section) which I used for the textures and normal maps. If people are interested in contributing, I will create or post a guide on how to make normal maps yourself.

## Credits
Thanks to MinecraftForum user [Topfpflanze91](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Topfpflanze91)! I used his [Default Improved Resourcepack](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2539470-default-improved-normal-specular-parallax) for the textures and normal maps.

## Disclaimer
I am a total noob in Blender, I can barely get by. Things probably have been done sub-optimally. If anyone more knowledgeable is willing to take over, I would be more than happy to!
